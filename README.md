##About the Open Data Challenge Series

The Open Data Challenge Series is a series of challenge prizes designed to generate innovative and sustainable solutions to social challenges using open data.

Led by the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/) and the [Centre for Challenge Prizes](http://www.nesta.org.uk/our-projects/centre-challenge-prizes) at [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/) each challenge will invite participants to compete for a potential Â£40,000 prize. Winning projects will be those with the best solution which combines open data with a credible plan and market. The Open Data Challenge Prize Series is funded by the [Technology Strategy Board](https://www.innovateuk.org/en) and the [Department for Business, Innovation and Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills).

This series uniquely combines the technical expertise and network of the Open Data Institute and the challenge prize methodology and charitable aims of Nesta. The challenges will help SMEs and start-ups to work with data providers, industry experts and business leaders to develop new ways to reuse available data in ways which create sustainable business opportunities.

The seven themes will run until September 2015. This dataset was prepared for the use of the participants in the Education challenge.

##About the Open Data Challenge Series - Education datasets

The Open Data Challenge Series team has pre-selected a series of education open data datasets, specified at [thir URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aswdg5Zc6wBhdFpRbUFacXd3WDZ6SV9mdzQtLVFFVmc&usp=sharing), that could be used by the participants as a starting point. 

Among these, two datasets in particular, issued by the UK Government's Department for Education (DfE) were identified as perhaps the most interesting for the volume of information they offer and for being very recent, both published on 23rd January 2014. The team decided to further study and prepare them for the participants' use. They are:

- "GCSE and equivalent attainment by pupil characteristics: 2012 to 2013", published at [this URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-and-equivalent-attainment-by-pupil-characteristics-2012-to-2013), and 
- "GCSE and equivalent results in England, 2012 to 2013 (revised)", published at [this URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2012-to-2013-revised)

The objective of the work contained in this repository is to collect the data, pre-process and clean it to streamline further work by the Open Data Challenge Series participants.
